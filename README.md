# Light Grid Towers

An animated theme for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). A city of glowing towers at night, light-cycles racing down the avenue to a great tower's beam.

> **Animated with [omarchy-live-wallpaper](https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper).**
> Install that plugin too (below) to make the wallpaper move and to get the
> **Light Grid Towers Lite** version. Without it the theme still works, with a still wallpaper.

## Install

Theme and plugin together:

```bash
omarchy theme install https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-light-grid-towers-theme && omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper --enable --yes
```

or one at a time:

```bash
omarchy theme install https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-light-grid-towers-theme
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper --enable
```

Then pick **Light Grid Towers** in Omarchy menu → Style → Theme. The first line is the theme
(colors, wallpaper, icons, keyboard lighting); the second makes the wallpaper move,
and also adds **Light Grid Towers Lite** to the picker: the same picture with only small
parts moving, which uses the least power. Without the plugin you get the theme
with a still wallpaper.

Update with `omarchy theme update` and `omarchy plugin update`.

## Light Grid Towers Lite

The same scene, still, with only its small details alive. It uses the least power,
which makes it good for battery or a calmer desktop:

## How it moves

The wallpaper is a GPU shader (`live/2-towers.frag.qsb`, source in `src/`) drawn by the
[live-wallpaper plugin](https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper);
`backgrounds/2-towers.png` is a frame of it, used by the lock screen and when the plugin
isn't installed. It pauses while a window covers the screen. See the plugin's README
for frame rates and battery settings.

Original artwork. The look is inspired by films and games; no logos or characters
are used.

## Performance

Measured on a Dell Latitude 9520 (Intel Iris Xe graphics, 8 threads) driving a 3440×1440
monitor, plugged in, with the plugin's default 30 fps. The wallpaper pauses whenever a window
covers the screen, so these are the costs while it's actually visible:

| Mode | GPU used | Wallpaper CPU | Compositor CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Still (plugin off) | ~0% | 2% | 4% |
| **Light Grid Towers Lite** | ~14% | 12% | 9% |
| **Light Grid Towers** | ~26% | 8% | 9% |

*GPU used* is how busy the GPU was, weighted by its clock speed against its maximum
(1350 MHz here). *CPU* is a share of one core. On battery the plugin draws at half
resolution and 10 fps by default, which is lighter still (plugin 1.1.2 or later: run
`omarchy plugin update`). To draw at half resolution plugged in too, set
`"renderScale": 0.5` in `~/.config/omarchy/live-wallpaper.json` (see the
[plugin's README](https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper)).

## Making changes

The scene is `src/<name>.frag` (with `src/common.glsl`): edit it, then run

```bash
tools/build.sh           # rebuilds live/, the still in backgrounds/ and preview.jpg
tools/build.sh --media   # also the animated previews in media/ (a few minutes)
```

and commit the results. Needs `qt6-shadertools`, `qt6-declarative`, ImageMagick and
(for `--media`) ffmpeg. To try a change on your own desktop, run
`omarchy theme update` after pushing, or copy the built files into
`~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`.
